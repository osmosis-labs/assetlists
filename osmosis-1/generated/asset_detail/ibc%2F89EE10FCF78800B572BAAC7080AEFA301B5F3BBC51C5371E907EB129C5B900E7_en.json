  "description": "LBTC is liquid, yield-bearing, natively cross-chain, and 1:1 backed by bitcoin.\n\nLombard is dedicated to expanding the digital economy by transforming Bitcoin\u2019s utility from a mere store of value into a productive financial tool. While Bitcoin remains the world\u2019s largest crypto asset, with over $1 trillion worth of Bitcoin often sitting idle, its utility is limited compared to other digital assets. Lombard sees a significant opportunity to change this by connecting Bitcoin to decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nLombard is driven by the fact that if just 10% of Bitcoin's $1.5 trillion market cap flows into DeFi, the total value locked (TVL) in the ecosystem could more than double, catalyzing unprecedented growth and enabling sustainable market dynamics over time. Lombard believes this potential can be unlocked through a security-first liquid Bitcoin primitive\u2014LBTC.\n\nOur flagship product, LBTC, is a secure Bitcoin liquid staked token (LST), designed to empower anyone\u2014from individual holders to large institutions\u2014to amplify the utility of their Bitcoin. It allows users to earn a native yield from providing economic security to networks via Babylon and participate in DeFi, all while maintaining the value of the original asset.\n\nBy building LBTC on top of Babylon, Lombard\u2019s LBTC bridges the gap between Bitcoin\u2019s immense economic value, security capabilities, and the dynamic opportunities within PoS and DeFi ecosystems, marking a transformative phase for Bitcoin in the decentralized economy.",
