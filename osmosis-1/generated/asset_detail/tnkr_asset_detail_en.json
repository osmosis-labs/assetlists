  "description": "The native fee, governance and staking token of the Tinkernet Parachain.\n\nTinkernet is a Kusama parachain and the sister-chain of the InvArch Network on Polkadot. Tinkernet is an experimental proving ground where omnichain account & DAO governance protocols are deployed and tested before deploying on the InvArch Network. Protocols on Tinkernet realize features such as multichain multisig accounts & DAO Staking. Unlike a testnet, Tinkernet features real value."
