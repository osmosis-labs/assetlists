  "description": "The native staking token of Terra Classic.\n\nTerra Classic was designed to create a decentralized financial infrastructure using algorithmic stablecoins like UST, which were pegged to various fiat currencies. The platform's native token, LUNA, played a crucial role in stabilizing the stablecoins through a mint-and-burn mechanism. Despite facing significant challenges, Terra Classic paved the way for Terra 2.0, which aims to rebuild and improve upon the original vision. Terra Classic continues to operate with a focus on supporting decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and stablecoin solutions."
