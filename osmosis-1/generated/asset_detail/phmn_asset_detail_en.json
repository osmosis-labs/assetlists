Similar to PoS chains, each holder possesses voting rights proportionate to the number of locked tokens. PHMN holders can govern the POSTHUMAN validator via DAODAO. For instance, decisions such as diversifying the treasury, updating the validator's commission rate, or exiting the network are determined by the PHMN community."
