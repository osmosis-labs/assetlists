  "description": "The native staking and governance token of Kava\n\nThe native staking and governance token of Kava\n\nKava is a Layer-1 blockchain that combines the speed and interoperability of Cosmos with the developer power of Ethereum.\n\nThe Kava Network uses a developer-optimized co-chain architecture. The Ethereum Co-Chain enables support for EVM smart contracts while the Cosmos Co-Chain enables the lightning-fast Tendermint consensus engine and the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).\n\nThe two co-chains are connected by a translator module that enables them to interoperate seamlessly, bringing the two most used blockchain development environments together in a single, scalable network.\n\nThe Kava Network features a native governance and utility token, KAVA, that can be staked by validators or delegated to validator nodes. Stakers and delegators earn 37.5% of all KAVA emissions as a reward for securing the network. Kava stakers also have voting rights in network governance proposals."
