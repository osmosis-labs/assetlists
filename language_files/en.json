It achieves this by using sidechains for off-chain computation while ensuring asset security using the Plasma framework and a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators. Polygon supports various DeFi and NFT projects by providing a faster, more efficient, and low-cost environment for transactions. Its native token, MATIC, is used for staking, governance, and paying transaction fees on the network. The platform aims to transform Ethereum into a multi-chain system, similar to Polkadot, but with the benefits of Ethereum's security and vibrant ecosystem."

By staking BTC through Lorenzo, users receive stBTC, which is redeemable 1-to-1 for the original Bitcoin. This mechanism allows users to earn yield without sacrificing liquidity, as stBTC can be freely utilized within the Lorenzo DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe innovative dual-token system of stBTC and Yield Accruing Tokens (YATs) empowers users to not only stake their BTC but also engage in various decentralized finance activities such as trading, lending, and collateralization. This enhances the utility and flexibility of Bitcoin, providing additional financial opportunities while contributing to the security of PoS networks.\n\nstBTC's role in the Lorenzo protocol illustrates its importance in creating a highly interconnected and efficient financial ecosystem, making it a valuable asset in the broader landscape of decentralized finance."
