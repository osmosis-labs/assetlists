  "description": "Terra Classic is the original blockchain platform that powered the UST stablecoin and LUNA token before the launch of Terra 2.0, focusing on stablecoins and DeFi applications.\n\nTerra Classic was designed to create a decentralized financial infrastructure using algorithmic stablecoins like UST, which were pegged to various fiat currencies. The platform's native token, LUNA, played a crucial role in stabilizing the stablecoins through a mint-and-burn mechanism. Despite facing significant challenges, Terra Classic paved the way for Terra 2.0, which aims to rebuild and improve upon the original vision. Terra Classic continues to operate with a focus on supporting decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and stablecoin solutions.",
