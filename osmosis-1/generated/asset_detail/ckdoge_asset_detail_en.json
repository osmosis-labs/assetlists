  "description": "A multi-chain dogecoin twin, trustlessly created by chain-key cryptography and Internet Computer smart contracts that directly hold raw dogecoin.\n\nChain-key Dogecoin (ckDOGE) is a bridge token that is backed 1:1 by DOGE held 100% on the ICP mainnet. ckDOGE does not rely on a centralized bridge to facilitate the conversion between DOGE and ckDOGE, which makes it substantially more secure when compared to other traditional 'wrapped' tokens."
