      "description": "The native token of Osmosis\n\nOsmosis (OSMO) is the premier DEX and cross-chain DeFi hub within the Cosmos ecosystem, a network of over 50 sovereign, interoperable blockchains seamlessly connected through the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC). Pioneering in its approach, Osmosis offers a dynamic trading and liquidity provision experience, integrating non-IBC assets from other ecosystems, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot. Initially adopting Balancer-style pools, Osmosis now also features a concentrated liquidity model that is orders of magnitude more capital efficient, meaning that significantly less liquidity is required to handle the same amount of trading volume with minimal slippage.\n\nAs a true appchain, Osmosis has greater control over the full blockchain stack than traditional smart contract DEXs, which must follow the code of the parent chain that it is built on. This fine-grained control has enabled, for example, the development of Superfluid Staking, an extension of Proof of Stake that allows assets at the application layer to be staked to secure the chain. The customizability of appchains also allows implementing features like the Protocol Revenue module, which enables Osmosis to conduct on-chain arbitrage on behalf of OSMO stakers, balancing prices across pools while generating real yield revenue from this volume. Additionally, as a sovereign appchain, Osmosis governance can vote on upgrades to the protocol. One example of this was the introduction of a Taker Fee, which switched on the collection of exchange fees to generate diverse yield from Osmosis volume and distribute it to OSMO stakers.\n\nOsmosis is bringing the full centralized exchange experience to the decentralized world by building a cross-chain native DEX and trading suite that connects all chains over IBC, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. To reach this goal, Osmosis hosts an ever-expanding suite of DeFi applications aimed at providing a one-stop experience that includes lending, credit, margin, DeFi strategy vaults, power perps, fiat on-ramps, NFTs, stablecoins, and more — all of the functionalities that centralized exchange offer and more, in the trust-minimized environment of decentralized finance.",

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum was designed to be a platform for applications that can operate without the need for intermediaries, using blockchain technology. This has made Ethereum a leading platform for various applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more.

Last but not least, an Inter-blockchain Communication protocol makes it easier for blockchain networks to communicate with each other — preventing fragmentation in the industry.\n\nCosmos Hub's origins can be dated back to 2014, when Tendermint, a core contributor to the network, was founded. In 2016, a white paper for Cosmos was published — and a token sale was held the following year. ATOM tokens are earned through a hybrid proof-of-stake algorithm, and they help to keep the Cosmos Hub, the project’s flagship blockchain, secure.

Filecoin aims to store data in a decentralized manner, unlike traditional cloud storage providers.\n\nParticipants in the Filecoin network are incentivized to act honestly and store as much data as possible because they earn the Filecoin cryptocurrency (FIL) in exchange for their storage services. This setup ensures the integrity and accessibility of data stored. Filecoin's model allows for a variety of storage options, including long-term archival storage and more rapid retrieval services, making it a versatile solution for decentralized data storage.

The protocol is an interaction between three parties:\n-Publishers submit pricing information to Pyth's oracle program. Pyth has multiple data publishers for every product to improve the accuracy and robustness of the system.\n-Pyth's oracle program combines publishers' data to produce a single aggregate price and confidence interval.\nConsumers read the price information produced by the oracle program.\n\nPyth's oracle program runs simultaneously on both Solana mainnet and Pythnet. Each instance of the program is responsible for its own set of price feeds. Solana Price Feeds are available for use by Solana protocols. In this case, since the oracle program itself runs on Solana, the resulting prices are immediately available to consumers without requiring any additional work. Pythnet Price Feeds are available on 12+ blockchains. The prices constructed on Pythnet are transferred cross-chain to reach consumers on these blockchains.\n\nIn both cases, the critical component of the system is the oracle program that combines the data from each individual publisher. This program maintains a number of different Solana accounts that list the products on Pyth and their current price data. Publishers publish their price and confidence by interacting with the oracle program on every slot. The program stores this information in its accounts. The first price update in a slot additionally triggers price aggregation, which combines the price data from the previous slot into a single aggregate price and confidence interval. This aggregate price is written to the Solana account where it is readable by other on-chain programs and available for transmission to other blockchains.",

It aims to manage risk and provide benefits to both traders and liquidity providers.\n\nFor traders, Levana's solution is to make all positions \"well-funded,\" meaning that the maximum profit for each position is locked in advance. This eliminates the possibility of bad debt and insolvency, providing greater security.\n\nLiquidity providers, on the other hand, receive a yield for taking on the risk of market instability. They supply funds that act as collateral, and in return, they earn a fee with a risk premium.\n\nThe protocol addresses the issues with existing perpetual swap models, such as the virtual AMM. These models rely on complex mechanisms to maintain price stability, but they have limitations and can be risky in volatile markets.\n\nBy separating different trading pairs and creating a decentralized market for liquidity, Levana reduces the risk of contagion between different markets. This also makes it easier to expand to other blockchain networks.\n\nOverall, Levana's perpetual swaps protocol offers a reliable and secure platform for traders and liquidity providers. It ensures fair settlement, minimizes risks, and allows for the development of additional financial protocols on top of tokenized positions.",

Initially launched in 2021, the protocol first debuted as a token bridge, allowing the transfer of tokens between blockchains, most notably between Solana and Ethereum. Wormhole later evolved, with Wormhole V2, to take on a more general approach, turning into an interoperability layer on which chains and decentralized applications could easily build on.\n\nWormhole V2 is a general messaging protocol, enabling different blockchains to communicate with one another. This technology could be used for a variety of use cases, including transfer of tokens between chains, enabling cross-chain governance for protocols that operated across chains as well as transfers of NFTs across chains, which could be utilized for multi-chain games. Wormhole V2 also saw the protocol expand its services to include Osmosis.\n\nTo date, the protocol has processed over $40 billion worth of value transfer across the blockchains supported, and over 1 billion messages sent. It supports over 30 blockchains, including most of the leading networks, and has a thriving ecosystem of over 200 applications built using Wormhole's technology.\n\nIn November 2023, Jump and Wormhole announced their intention to split ways. Following the separation, Wormhole announced that it raised $225 million, valuing the company at $2.5 billion. Investors include Brevan Howard, Coinbase Ventures, Multicoin Capital, Jump Crypto and more.",
