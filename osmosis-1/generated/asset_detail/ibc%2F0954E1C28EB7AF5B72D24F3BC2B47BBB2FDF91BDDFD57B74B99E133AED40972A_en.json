These contracts allow developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) that can utilize sensitive data without exposing it on the blockchain. By incorporating privacy-preserving technologies, Secret Network ensures that data remains confidential while still enabling complex computations and interactions. The native token, SCRT, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, empowering users to participate in the network's operations and decision-making processes.
