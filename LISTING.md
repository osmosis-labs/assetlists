# Rules for Asset Listings

## Osmosis Chain
 - Completely permissionless

## Osmosis Zone App

### Prerequisites
 - Asset, origin chain, and required IBC connection are registered to the Cosmos Chain Registry
 - At least one integrated wallet supports the origin chain, asset
   - (Note: native wallet support is not required as long as some chain suggestion or addChain method works)
 - A transfer/bridge interface exists for non-standard asset transfers


### Listing as an Unverified Asset (pseudo-permissionless)
 - Nearly all assets are accepted, except those that:
   - Are deceptive(--cannot imitate other assets via name, symbol, or logo),
   - Lack an associated identity (may be pseudonymous)
     - The submitting GitHub account should have a significant (and public) contribution history visible on their GitHub profile.
       - Asset listing PRs from brand new GitHub accounts generally will not be accepted, unless another GitHub account with a significant history leaves a supportive comment on the PR.


### Upgrade Asset to Verified Status (permissioned)

#### Qualification Criteria
 - Nearly all assets can become verified once validation has passed and basic requirements have been met, except those that:
   - Show signs of being a scam, or the team showing nefarious behaviour(, e.g., evidence of rug-pull or pump-n-dump), or
   - No pool exists that contains at least $1k USD-worth of liquidity of the asset

#### Requirements

Registered Asset Metadata at the [Cosmos Chain Registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry):
 - All standard required values: Name, Symbol, Base, Display, Type_asset (sdk.coin vs cw20 vs erc20 vs ...), etc.
 - A meaningful `description`.
 - A detailed `extended_description` (not required for 'Memecoins'--must be categorized as "meme").
 - Associated `socials`, including `website` and `twitter` (not required for 'Memecoins'--must be categorized as "meme").
 - Logo Image has a square Aspect Ratio and < 250 KB file size

Asset appearance and functionality must be validated by Osmosis Zone maintainers. This includes:
 - Verifying the asset's details (name, [ticker] symbol, logo image, and its origin chain's name)
 - Verifying that the asset has a price
 - Trading the asset
 - Withdraw and Deposit the asset to/from the source chain
   - For in-app transfers,
     - IBC transfers must resolve without errors (watch out for CORS blocking), and
     - The RPC endpoint has WSS enabled so it can communicate the transfer status back to Osmosis Zone without having to refresh.
   - For in-app Deposits,
     - The transaction URL goes opens the correct transaction page on a working block explorer for the source chain.
     - The Chain Suggestion (the method that adds the chain to a wallet) provides correct and sufficent data to complete all standard wallet actions for the source chain (includes the asset as a currency, provides all fee currencies and rate options, can query chain state and initiate transactions, etc.)
   - For external interface transfers,
     - The override URL(s) redirect users to the correct interface, including appropriate URL params where applicable.


#### Notify about Verified Status Upgrade
To propose that an asset should be upgraded to Verified status, please submit a Pull Requiest to this repository:
 - The PR should update the asset's `"osmosis_verified"` property value to `true` in the [zone_assets](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/assetlists/blob/main/osmosis-1/osmosis.zone_assets.json) file.
 - In the Descrption or Conversation of the PR, please provide the ID of a pool containing the asset (needed for validation)



### Full Integration for Best Experience (recommended)

Osmosis Frontend aims to foster a polished and complete user experience when users intereact with an asset. This is best provided when the asset has all metadata registered correctly and thoroughly, as well as be recognized by key external interfaces, and have sufficient and efficient liquidity on Osmosis.

Registered Asset Metadata at the [Cosmos Chain Registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry):
 - The correct `coingecko_id`:
   - Verify its inclusion via [CoinGecko's Coins List API (v3)](https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/list)
   - Use the `id` value--NOT symbol or name
 - High Quality Logo Image:
   - Image resolution at least 200x200 (should look crisp, with no compression artifacts, and no unintentional blur)
   - Image adequately contrasts against Osmosis Zone's background colour
   - Any opaque image content would fit entirely within an imaginary circle inscribed within the square file shape
     - That is, the logo image should not have content in the corners of the file. Some exceptions may apply, though they are intentional and rare.
     - For example, note how the unicorn's horn does not exit the boundary of the imaginary inscribed circle. This example follows these guidelines:

Integrations with Key Apps:
 - Recognition by key Block Explorers:
   - Mintscan (Assets are added at [Cosmostation's Chainlist](https://github.com/cosmostation/chainlist/blob/main/chain/osmosis/assets.json))
   - Celatone (Assets are added at [Celatone's Data Repository](https://github.com/alleslabs/aldus/blob/main/data/assets.json))
 - Recognition by key Data Aggregators:
   - CoinGecko (See: [How to list new Cryptocurrencies on CoinGecko](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/articles/7291312302617-How-to-list-new-cryptocurrencies-on-CoinGecko))
     - Has Price, Supply, and Market Capitzalization Data
     - Includes Osmosis Market(s)
       - I.E., Osmosis Pools containing the asset should be discoverable from the asset's CoinGecko page. E.G.:
         ![image](https://github.com/JeremyParish69/assetlists/assets/95667791/34ea402b-1a0f-4e43-9bfc-b750c9ab9430)

Liquidity on Osmosis:
 - At least $10k USD-worth of liquidity on Osmosis DEX
 - At least one pool of type: Supercharged Liquidity(CL), Stableswap, Transmuter/Alloyed Asset, or Astroport PCL.
   - Note that this requirement is NOT met by an instance of the Weighted ('xyk') pool type, which are less strategic for traders and liquidity providers than other pool types.
   - Note that although Supercharged Liquidity is the recommended pool type for most assets, this type of pool cannot be created via the Osmosis Zone frontend interface.
   - See the [Pool Setup Guide](https://docs.osmosis.zone/overview/integrate/pool-setup) for instructions on setting up a Liquidity Pool on Osmosis.

    

### Downgrade Asset from Verified status
 - Decommissioning or delegitimization of the asset or its native chain (e.g., UST during the Terra [Classic] collapse)
