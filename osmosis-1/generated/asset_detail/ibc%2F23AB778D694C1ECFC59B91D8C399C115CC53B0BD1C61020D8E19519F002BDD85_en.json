  "description": "Archway is a smart contract platform in the Cosmos ecosystem designed to reward developers by providing them with a share of transaction fees generated by their applications.\n\nArchway aims to incentivize developers by sharing a portion of the transaction fees generated by their decentralized applications (dApps) built on the platform. This innovative approach helps align the interests of developers with the network's growth and sustainability. Archway's native token, ARCH, is used for staking, governance, and distributing rewards to developers. By leveraging the Cosmos SDK, Archway ensures interoperability and scalability, allowing developers to build and deploy efficient and high-performance dApps.",
