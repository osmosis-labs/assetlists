# Asset Lists

Asset Lists are inspired by the [Token Lists](https://tokenlists.org/) project on Ethereum which helps discoverability of ERC20 tokens by providing a mapping between erc20 contract addresses and their associated metadata.

Asset lists are a similar mechanism to allow frontends and other UIs to fetch metadata associated with Cosmos SDK denoms, especially for assets sent over IBC.

This standard is a work in progress. You'll notice that the format of `assets` in the assetlist.json structure is a strict superset json representation of the [`banktypes.DenomMetadata`](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/architecture/adr-024-coin-metadata.html) from the Cosmos SDK. This is purposefully done so that this standard may eventually be migrated into a Cosmos SDK module in the future, so it can be easily maintained on chain instead of on Github.

The assetlist JSON Schema can be found [here](/assetlist.schema.json)

An example assetlist json contains the following structure:

```
