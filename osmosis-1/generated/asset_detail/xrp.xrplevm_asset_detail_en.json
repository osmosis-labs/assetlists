  "description": "The native token of the XRPL EVM Sidechain\n\nXRP is the native token of XRPL EVM, used for gas and fees. Though originally bridged from XRPL via Axelar, this token is fully integrated into XRPL EVM as a Cosmos SDK coin and ERC-20 precompile, and is treated as the canonical native asset of the chain."
