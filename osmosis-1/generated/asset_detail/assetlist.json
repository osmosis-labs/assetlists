Pioneering in its approach, Osmosis offers a dynamic trading and liquidity provision experience, integrating non-IBC assets from other ecosystems, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot. Initially adopting Balancer-style pools, Osmosis now also features a concentrated liquidity model that is orders of magnitude more capital efficient, meaning that significantly less liquidity is required to handle the same amount of trading volume with minimal slippage.\n\nAs a true appchain, Osmosis has greater control over the full blockchain stack than traditional smart contract DEXs, which must follow the code of the parent chain that it is built on. This fine-grained control has enabled, for example, the development of Superfluid Staking, an extension of Proof of Stake that allows assets at the application layer to be staked to secure the chain. The customizability of appchains also allows implementing features like the Protocol Revenue module, which enables Osmosis to conduct on-chain arbitrage on behalf of OSMO stakers, balancing prices across pools while generating real yield revenue from this volume. Additionally, as a sovereign appchain, Osmosis governance can vote on upgrades to the protocol. One example of this was the introduction of a Taker Fee, which switched on the collection of exchange fees to generate diverse yield from Osmosis volume and distribute it to OSMO stakers.\n\nOsmosis is bringing the full centralized exchange experience to the decentralized world by building a cross-chain native DEX and trading suite that connects all chains over IBC, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. To reach this goal, Osmosis hosts an ever-expanding suite of DeFi applications aimed at providing a one-stop experience that includes lending, credit, margin, DeFi strategy vaults, power perps, fiat on-ramps, NFTs, stablecoins, and more — all of the functionalities that centralized exchange offer and more, in the trust-minimized environment of decentralized finance.",

BNB was created to facilitate various operations on the Binance platform, such as reducing transaction fees for traders when paid with BNB, participating in token sales on Binance Launchpad, and more. Over time, the utility of BNB has expanded beyond the Binance platform, with it being used in a variety of applications including payment for goods and services, online and offline, and even for booking travel arrangements through partners.\n\nIn addition to its wide range of uses, BNB has a unique deflationary mechanism known as coin burns. Binance commits to using 20% of its profits each quarter to buy back and burn BNB, effectively reducing the total supply over time and increasing its scarcity. This mechanism is aimed at boosting the value of BNB by controlling its supply. The ongoing development of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a parallel blockchain that runs smart contracts and is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), further enhances BNB's utility by supporting decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and other blockchain-based projects.

Pyth has multiple data publishers for every product to improve the accuracy and robustness of the system.\n-Pyth's oracle program combines publishers' data to produce a single aggregate price and confidence interval.\nConsumers read the price information produced by the oracle program.\n\nPyth's oracle program runs simultaneously on both Solana mainnet and Pythnet. Each instance of the program is responsible for its own set of price feeds. Solana Price Feeds are available for use by Solana protocols. In this case, since the oracle program itself runs on Solana, the resulting prices are immediately available to consumers without requiring any additional work. Pythnet Price Feeds are available on 12+ blockchains. The prices constructed on Pythnet are transferred cross-chain to reach consumers on these blockchains.\n\nIn both cases, the critical component of the system is the oracle program that combines the data from each individual publisher. This program maintains a number of different Solana accounts that list the products on Pyth and their current price data. Publishers publish their price and confidence by interacting with the oracle program on every slot. The program stores this information in its accounts. The first price update in a slot additionally triggers price aggregation, which combines the price data from the previous slot into a single aggregate price and confidence interval. This aggregate price is written to the Solana account where it is readable by other on-chain programs and available for transmission to other blockchains.",

It aims to manage risk and provide benefits to both traders and liquidity providers.\n\nFor traders, Levana's solution is to make all positions \"well-funded,\" meaning that the maximum profit for each position is locked in advance. This eliminates the possibility of bad debt and insolvency, providing greater security.\n\nLiquidity providers, on the other hand, receive a yield for taking on the risk of market instability. They supply funds that act as collateral, and in return, they earn a fee with a risk premium.\n\nThe protocol addresses the issues with existing perpetual swap models, such as the virtual AMM. These models rely on complex mechanisms to maintain price stability, but they have limitations and can be risky in volatile markets.\n\nBy separating different trading pairs and creating a decentralized market for liquidity, Levana reduces the risk of contagion between different markets. This also makes it easier to expand to other blockchain networks.\n\nOverall, Levana's perpetual swaps protocol offers a reliable and secure platform for traders and liquidity providers.

Initially launched in 2021, the protocol first debuted as a token bridge, allowing the transfer of tokens between blockchains, most notably between Solana and Ethereum. Wormhole later evolved, with Wormhole V2, to take on a more general approach, turning into an interoperability layer on which chains and decentralized applications could easily build on.\n\nWormhole V2 is a general messaging protocol, enabling different blockchains to communicate with one another. This technology could be used for a variety of use cases, including transfer of tokens between chains, enabling cross-chain governance for protocols that operated across chains as well as transfers of NFTs across chains, which could be utilized for multi-chain games. Wormhole V2 also saw the protocol expand its services to include Osmosis.\n\nTo date, the protocol has processed over $40 billion worth of value transfer across the blockchains supported, and over 1 billion messages sent. It supports over 30 blockchains, including most of the leading networks, and has a thriving ecosystem of over 200 applications built using Wormhole's technology.\n\nIn November 2023, Jump and Wormhole announced their intention to split ways. Following the separation, Wormhole announced that it raised $225 million, valuing the company at $2.5 billion.

It was designed as a decentralized digital currency, allowing peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority or intermediary. Bitcoin operates on a technology called blockchain, a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. The security and integrity of the blockchain are maintained through a process called mining, where participants solve complex mathematical problems to validate and add new transactions to the blockchain. Bitcoin's decentralized nature and limited supply, capped at 21 million coins, have contributed to its status as \"digital gold\" and a store of value.\n\nBitcoin has significantly influenced the financial world, inspiring the development of thousands of other cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. Its adoption has grown over the years, with numerous merchants and service providers accepting it as a payment method. Additionally, Bitcoin has become a popular investment asset, attracting both individual and institutional investors. Despite its volatility and regulatory challenges, Bitcoin remains a dominant force in the crypto space, symbolizing the potential for a more open and inclusive financial system.

Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a digital currency, Ethereum is designed to be a decentralized platform for running smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). These smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code, enabling trustless and automated transactions without intermediaries. Ethereum's blockchain can host a wide variety of applications, from financial services to gaming, making it a versatile and powerful tool in the world of blockchain technology.\n\nOne of the most notable features of Ethereum is its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), which is used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the network. Ethereum has also been the backbone for the explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), which seeks to recreate traditional financial systems with blockchain-based alternatives. Additionally, Ethereum is undergoing a significant upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve scalability, security, and energy efficiency through a shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms.

By staking BTC through Lorenzo, users receive stBTC, which is redeemable 1-to-1 for the original Bitcoin. This mechanism allows users to earn yield without sacrificing liquidity, as stBTC can be freely utilized within the Lorenzo DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe innovative dual-token system of stBTC and Yield Accruing Tokens (YATs) empowers users to not only stake their BTC but also engage in various decentralized finance activities such as trading, lending, and collateralization. This enhances the utility and flexibility of Bitcoin, providing additional financial opportunities while contributing to the security of PoS networks.\n\nstBTC's role in the Lorenzo protocol illustrates its importance in creating a highly interconnected and efficient financial ecosystem, making it a valuable asset in the broader landscape of decentralized finance.",
