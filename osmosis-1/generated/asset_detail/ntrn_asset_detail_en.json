  "description": "The native token of Neutron chain.\n\nNeutron is a blockchain network designed to bring smart contracts to the Cosmos ecosystem using CosmWasm. It leverages Interchain Security to rely on the Cosmos Hub's validator set, enhancing its security without needing its own validators. This allows Neutron to provide robust, cross-chain smart contract applications across more than 50 interconnected blockchains. Neutron's focus on interchain queries and transactions enables secure data retrieval and transaction execution across multiple chains, fostering the development of complex and decentralized applications within the Cosmos network."
