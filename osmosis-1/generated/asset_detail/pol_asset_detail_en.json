  "description": "Polygon combines the best of Ethereum and sovereign blockchains into a full-fledged multi-chain system.\n\nPOL (ex-MATIC) is the native coin of the Polygon network, used to pay transaction fees and staking rewards. It's also an ERC-20 token and will power a vast ecosystem of zero-knowledge-based Layer 2 chains. POL will gradually replace the current MATIC token over 4 years as part of Polygon 2.0."
