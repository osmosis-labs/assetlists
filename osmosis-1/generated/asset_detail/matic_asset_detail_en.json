  "description": "Polygon, previously known as Matic Network, is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions.\n\nPolygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to improve the scalability and usability of the Ethereum blockchain. It achieves this by using sidechains for off-chain computation while ensuring asset security using the Plasma framework and a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators. Polygon supports various DeFi and NFT projects by providing a faster, more efficient, and low-cost environment for transactions. Its native token, MATIC, is used for staking, governance, and paying transaction fees on the network. The platform aims to transform Ethereum into a multi-chain system, similar to Polkadot, but with the benefits of Ethereum's security and vibrant ecosystem."
