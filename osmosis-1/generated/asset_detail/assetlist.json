      "description": "The native token of Osmosis\n\nOsmosis (OSMO) is the premier DEX and cross-chain DeFi hub within the Cosmos ecosystem, a network of over 50 sovereign, interoperable blockchains seamlessly connected through the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC). Pioneering in its approach, Osmosis offers a dynamic trading and liquidity provision experience, integrating non-IBC assets from other ecosystems, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot. Initially adopting Balancer-style pools, Osmosis now also features a concentrated liquidity model that is orders of magnitude more capital efficient, meaning that significantly less liquidity is required to handle the same amount of trading volume with minimal slippage.\n\nAs a true appchain, Osmosis has greater control over the full blockchain stack than traditional smart contract DEXs, which must follow the code of the parent chain that it is built on. This fine-grained control has enabled, for example, the development of Superfluid Staking, an extension of Proof of Stake that allows assets at the application layer to be staked to secure the chain. The customizability of appchains also allows implementing features like the Protocol Revenue module, which enables Osmosis to conduct on-chain arbitrage on behalf of OSMO stakers, balancing prices across pools while generating real yield revenue from this volume. Additionally, as a sovereign appchain, Osmosis governance can vote on upgrades to the protocol. One example of this was the introduction of a Taker Fee, which switched on the collection of exchange fees to generate diverse yield from Osmosis volume and distribute it to OSMO stakers.\n\nOsmosis is bringing the full centralized exchange experience to the decentralized world by building a cross-chain native DEX and trading suite that connects all chains over IBC, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. To reach this goal, Osmosis hosts an ever-expanding suite of DeFi applications aimed at providing a one-stop experience that includes lending, credit, margin, DeFi strategy vaults, power perps, fiat on-ramps, NFTs, stablecoins, and more — all of the functionalities that centralized exchange offer and more, in the trust-minimized environment of decentralized finance.",

      "description": "Filecoin is a decentralized storage network designed to turn cloud storage into an algorithmic market. The network facilitates open markets for storing and retrieving data, where users pay to store their files on storage miners. Filecoin is built on top of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer storage network. Filecoin aims to store data in a decentralized manner, unlike traditional cloud storage providers.\n\nParticipants in the Filecoin network are incentivized to act honestly and store as much data as possible because they earn the Filecoin cryptocurrency (FIL) in exchange for their storage services. This setup ensures the integrity and accessibility of data stored. Filecoin's model allows for a variety of storage options, including long-term archival storage and more rapid retrieval services, making it a versatile solution for decentralized data storage. The project, developed by Protocol Labs, also focuses on ensuring that data is stored reliably and efficiently."

Pyth has multiple data publishers for every product to improve the accuracy and robustness of the system.\n-Pyth's oracle program combines publishers' data to produce a single aggregate price and confidence interval.\nConsumers read the price information produced by the oracle program.\n\nPyth's oracle program runs simultaneously on both Solana mainnet and Pythnet. Each instance of the program is responsible for its own set of price feeds. Solana Price Feeds are available for use by Solana protocols. In this case, since the oracle program itself runs on Solana, the resulting prices are immediately available to consumers without requiring any additional work. Pythnet Price Feeds are available on 12+ blockchains. The prices constructed on Pythnet are transferred cross-chain to reach consumers on these blockchains.\n\nIn both cases, the critical component of the system is the oracle program that combines the data from each individual publisher. This program maintains a number of different Solana accounts that list the products on Pyth and their current price data. Publishers publish their price and confidence by interacting with the oracle program on every slot. The program stores this information in its accounts. The first price update in a slot additionally triggers price aggregation, which combines the price data from the previous slot into a single aggregate price and confidence interval. This aggregate price is written to the Solana account where it is readable by other on-chain programs and available for transmission to other blockchains.",

It aims to manage risk and provide benefits to both traders and liquidity providers.\n\nFor traders, Levana's solution is to make all positions \"well-funded,\" meaning that the maximum profit for each position is locked in advance. This eliminates the possibility of bad debt and insolvency, providing greater security.\n\nLiquidity providers, on the other hand, receive a yield for taking on the risk of market instability. They supply funds that act as collateral, and in return, they earn a fee with a risk premium.\n\nThe protocol addresses the issues with existing perpetual swap models, such as the virtual AMM. These models rely on complex mechanisms to maintain price stability, but they have limitations and can be risky in volatile markets.\n\nBy separating different trading pairs and creating a decentralized market for liquidity, Levana reduces the risk of contagion between different markets. This also makes it easier to expand to other blockchain networks.\n\nOverall, Levana's perpetual swaps protocol offers a reliable and secure platform for traders and liquidity providers. It ensures fair settlement, minimizes risks, and allows for the development of additional financial protocols on top of tokenized positions.",

Migaloo incubated projects are encouraged to participate in OTC deals with Sail DAO in order to seed or enhance liquidity on WW's Osmosis DEX. However, offers are not limited to Migaloo projects and liquidity is not limited to being deployed on WW DEX. The treasury of this DAO can be deployed however it wishes at the discretion of the Sail DAO voters.

Initially launched in 2021, the protocol first debuted as a token bridge, allowing the transfer of tokens between blockchains, most notably between Solana and Ethereum. Wormhole later evolved, with Wormhole V2, to take on a more general approach, turning into an interoperability layer on which chains and decentralized applications could easily build on.\n\nWormhole V2 is a general messaging protocol, enabling different blockchains to communicate with one another. This technology could be used for a variety of use cases, including transfer of tokens between chains, enabling cross-chain governance for protocols that operated across chains as well as transfers of NFTs across chains, which could be utilized for multi-chain games. Wormhole V2 also saw the protocol expand its services to include Osmosis.\n\nTo date, the protocol has processed over $40 billion worth of value transfer across the blockchains supported, and over 1 billion messages sent. It supports over 30 blockchains, including most of the leading networks, and has a thriving ecosystem of over 200 applications built using Wormhole's technology.\n\nIn November 2023, Jump and Wormhole announced their intention to split ways. Following the separation, Wormhole announced that it raised $225 million, valuing the company at $2.5 billion. Investors include Brevan Howard, Coinbase Ventures, Multicoin Capital, Jump Crypto and more.",

It was designed as a decentralized digital currency, allowing peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority or intermediary. Bitcoin operates on a technology called blockchain, a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. The security and integrity of the blockchain are maintained through a process called mining, where participants solve complex mathematical problems to validate and add new transactions to the blockchain. Bitcoin's decentralized nature and limited supply, capped at 21 million coins, have contributed to its status as \"digital gold\" and a store of value.\n\nBitcoin has significantly influenced the financial world, inspiring the development of thousands of other cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. Its adoption has grown over the years, with numerous merchants and service providers accepting it as a payment method. Additionally, Bitcoin has become a popular investment asset, attracting both individual and institutional investors. Despite its volatility and regulatory challenges, Bitcoin remains a dominant force in the crypto space, symbolizing the potential for a more open and inclusive financial system. Its impact extends beyond finance, as it continues to drive innovation in areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, and digital identity verification.",

Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a digital currency, Ethereum is designed to be a decentralized platform for running smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). These smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code, enabling trustless and automated transactions without intermediaries. Ethereum's blockchain can host a wide variety of applications, from financial services to gaming, making it a versatile and powerful tool in the world of blockchain technology.\n\nOne of the most notable features of Ethereum is its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), which is used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the network. Ethereum has also been the backbone for the explosive growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), which seeks to recreate traditional financial systems with blockchain-based alternatives. Additionally, Ethereum is undergoing a significant upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0, which aims to improve scalability, security, and energy efficiency through a shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. This transition is expected to enhance the network's performance and reduce its environmental impact, further solidifying Ethereum's position as a leading platform in the blockchain ecosystem.",

Initially launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain in 2017, BNB has since migrated to Binance's own blockchain, the Binance Chain. BNB was created to facilitate various operations on the Binance platform, such as reducing transaction fees for traders when paid with BNB, participating in token sales on Binance Launchpad, and more. Over time, the utility of BNB has expanded beyond the Binance platform, with it being used in a variety of applications including payment for goods and services, online and offline, and even for booking travel arrangements through partners.\n\nIn addition to its wide range of uses, BNB has a unique deflationary mechanism known as coin burns. Binance commits to using 20% of its profits each quarter to buy back and burn BNB, effectively reducing the total supply over time and increasing its scarcity. This mechanism is aimed at boosting the value of BNB by controlling its supply. The ongoing development of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a parallel blockchain that runs smart contracts and is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), further enhances BNB's utility by supporting decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and other blockchain-based projects. BNB's role in both the Binance ecosystem and the broader crypto market continues to grow, making it a significant asset in the cryptocurrency space.",

While Bitcoin remains the world’s largest crypto asset, with over $1 trillion worth of Bitcoin often sitting idle, its utility is limited compared to other digital assets. Lombard sees a significant opportunity to change this by connecting Bitcoin to decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nLombard is driven by the fact that if just 10% of Bitcoin's $1.5 trillion market cap flows into DeFi, the total value locked (TVL) in the ecosystem could more than double, catalyzing unprecedented growth and enabling sustainable market dynamics over time. Lombard believes this potential can be unlocked through a security-first liquid Bitcoin primitive—LBTC.\n\nOur flagship product, LBTC, is a secure Bitcoin liquid staked token (LST), designed to empower anyone—from individual holders to large institutions—to amplify the utility of their Bitcoin. It allows users to earn a native yield from providing economic security to networks via Babylon and participate in DeFi, all while maintaining the value of the original asset.\n\nBy building LBTC on top of Babylon, Lombard’s LBTC bridges the gap between Bitcoin’s immense economic value, security capabilities, and the dynamic opportunities within PoS and DeFi ecosystems, marking a transformative phase for Bitcoin in the decentralized economy.",

      "description": "The native token of MilkyWay\n\nMilkyWay (MILK) is the first modular staking portal, designed to redefine security and scalability within the modular ecosystem. As a pioneer of modular staking, MilkyWay integrates liquid staking and restaking solutions to address fragmented trust and enhance crypto-economic security across networks.\n\nLaunched in December 2023 as the first liquid staking solution for the Celestia ecosystem, MilkyWay empowered users to unlock staked TIA positions and engage with various DeFi protocols. This initial phase introduced milkTIA which has seen widespread adoption to become the leading LST for TIA. Building on this success, MilkyWay is now entering Phase 2: a multi-asset, multi-chain modular restaking protocol.\n\nMilkyWay’s architecture is purpose-built for modularity . Unlike traditional solutions, its modular design allows Actively Validated Services (AVSs) to fully customize, or “Plug-in” their security solutions through programmable rules, including asset delegation and slashing mechanisms. By restaking native and liquid staked assets, users can provide security to AVSs or any off-chain program and system that require its own unique validation process for verification. This approach ensures seamless integration while minimizing operational complexity.\n\nThrough programmable rules, AVSs can define asset allocation and stake distribution, offering both operator-centric and AVS-centric models for greater control. Slashing rules further enhance security through customizable mechanisms like stake slash, jail slash, and burn slash, enabling AVSs to align these features with their risk profiles. These extensible features ensure MilkyWay evolves alongside the needs of its AVS partners, redefining staking and restaking with a focus on trust, innovation, and modularity.",
