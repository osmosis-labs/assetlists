  "description": "A multi-chain bitcoin twin, trustlessly created by chain-key cryptography and Internet Computer smart contracts that directly hold raw bitcoin.\n\nChain-key Bitcoin (ckBTC) is an ICRC-2-compliant token that is backed 1:1 by BTC held 100% on the mainnet. ckBTC does not rely on a centralized bridge to facilitate the conversion between BTC and ckBTC, which makes it substantially more secure when compared to other traditional 'wrapped' tokens."
